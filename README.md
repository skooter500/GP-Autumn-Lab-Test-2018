# DT508 Game Programming Supplemental Lab Test 2018 

Your job today is to make this sketch in Processing:

What is happening:

The face represents the player. The player can move left and right by pressing the left and right arrow keys. When the player is over the ladder, the up arrow key can be used to move the player upwards. There is no requirement for down. When the player reaches the key, the player changes to a happy face and the key disappears.

In your solution, you should use variables, functions with parameters, the if statement and one loop. You can optionally use classes.
